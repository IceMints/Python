Flask web project written at pythonanywhere.com.

Features include:

1) Authenticate sessions
For example, if the user with the username user1 logs in successfully, the browser is 
redirected to the URL /user/user1. Then if we try to open the page at /user/user2, 
the app redirects the browser to the login page.

2) SMS and email capability
After the user has authenticated, on the user's home page, provide forms so that the 
user can send an email using SendGrid account and can send an SMS text message 
using Twilio account. On the user's home page, provide a logout link so that the 
currently logged in user's session is terminated and the browser is redirected back to the URL /.

3) Basic username and password security features

Usernames are case-insensitive.

4) Environment variables are not hard-coded
