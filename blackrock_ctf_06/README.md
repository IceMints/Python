What are the optimal times to buy & sell fish?
As you know, the Daily D'eel is a big-time deals site that sells aquariums and other fish supplies. 
To do well as a business, the Daily D'eel team needs to buy inventory at a low price and sell it 
for a high one. Luckily, the team has access to tons of historical data and use this information 
to maximize the return.

In this challenge, you'll write a function that takes in a historical list of prices for an item 
and returns the maximum profit that the Daily D'eel could earn by buying and selling the item 
during the timeline. However, you cannot hold more than one of each item at a time and every 
time you sell an item you incur a small fee.

Your solution may be implemented in either Ruby, Python, or JavaScript. You can change your language 
using the dropdown in the top right of the page. When you click the "Run Code" button, your function 
will receive the following parameters:

Prices - An array of integers where the i-th element is the item's price on a given day.
Fee - An integer representing the transaction fee for selling an item.
Return an integer representing the maximum profit you can acheive to find the flag and solve this 
challenge. Good luck and happy fishing!
