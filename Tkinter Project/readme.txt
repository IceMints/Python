This program was created to demonstrate the knowledge of using 
python with Tkinter to create an application. I've included the 
original python files in this directory and converted the 
application into an EXE file with pyinstaller. The EXE file is 
in the Fruit_EXE folder. The EXE file will run with or without 
the .jpg file.
